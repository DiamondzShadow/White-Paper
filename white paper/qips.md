## QIP-001: Cross-Chain Integration via Chainlink CCIP

### Status
**Implemented** - Production Ready

### Summary
Integration of Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) to enable seamless cross-chain token transfers across multiple blockchain networks.

### Motivation
The Diamondz Shadow ecosystem requires robust cross-chain capabilities to:
- Enable token transfers between Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, and Base
- Maintain token supply consistency across chains through burn/mint mechanisms
- Provide secure and reliable cross-chain messaging
- Support the broader vision of universal media tokenization across multiple blockchain ecosystems

### Technical Specification

#### Core Features
1. **Burn/Mint Mechanism**
   - Source chain burns tokens when initiating cross-chain transfer
   - Destination chain mints equivalent tokens upon receipt
   - Maintains total supply consistency across all chains

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - `MINTER_ROLE` - Controls who can mint tokens (granted to CCIP pools)
   - `BURNER_ROLE` - Controls who can burn tokens (granted to CCIP pools)
   - Owner-controlled role management for security

3. **ERC677 TransferAndCall**
   - Enhanced ERC20 functionality
   - Single transaction token transfer with callback execution
   - Gas-efficient cross-chain operations

4. **Enhanced Cross-Chain Tracking**
   ```solidity
   function mintWithCCIPData(
       address account,
       uint256 amount,
       string calldata sourceChain,
       bytes32 ccipMessageId
   ) external onlyMinter
   ```
   - Captures source chain information
   - Links to CCIP message IDs
   - Emits `CrossChainMint` event for analytics

#### Event System
```solidity
event CrossChainMint(
    address indexed recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    string sourceChain,
    bytes32 ccipMessageId
);
```

### Security Considerations
- Only official CCIP pool contracts receive mint/burn permissions
- Maximum supply cap (5 billion tokens) prevents unlimited minting
- Owner account should use multisig for enhanced security
- Cross-chain mint patterns monitored for anomalies

### Supported Networks
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Polygon
- Avalanche
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- BNB Chain
- Base

### Resources
- [Chainlink CCIP Documentation](https://docs.chain.link/ccip)
