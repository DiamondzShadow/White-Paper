# How to Participate

#### How to Participate in the Diamondz Shadow Ecosystem

### Getting Started (Current Model)

Participation is designed around a **Web2-first user experience** with optional Web3 rails.
Core ecosystem project surfaces:

- **CrabbyTV** ([crabbytv.com](https://crabbytv.com))
- **TheTube** ([thetube.media](https://thetube.media))
- **OnlyShellz** ([onlyshellz.live](https://onlyshellz.live))

### 1. Onboarding

Diamondz Shadow uses embedded wallet infrastructure and account abstraction to keep onboarding simple:

- social login options (for example Google)
- auto-created smart account wallets
- gas-sponsorship for selected early interactions
- session-based approvals for lower friction

To join:

1. Open a supported ecosystem project surface.
2. Sign in with social or wallet connect.
3. Start using platform features without manual chain setup.
4. Optionally enable wallet payouts later.

### 2. How Users Participate

#### Viewers and Community Members

- purchase gifts/credits through fiat rails
- support creators through interactions, events, and premium features
- participate in community and governance pathways as they roll out

#### Creators

- publish and monetize content experiences
- progress through Wavz layers:
  - Milestone Units
  - Creator Credits
  - Reputation Badges
  - Wavz Score
- choose payout method (fiat or optional crypto rails)

### 3. Revenue and Value-Rail Participation

Current value routing is intentionally separated:

- **$Crabby**: qualifying CrabbyTV platform transaction capture
- **$SDM**: network and exchange-aligned value rail
  (including **https://zdiamondex.store/**)

CrabbyTV remains the primary qualifying-capture surface in the current policy.
TheTube and OnlyShellz monetization and capture integrations are governance-expandable.

### 4. Creator Payout Choices (Crypto Optional)

Creators can withdraw through:

- bank/ACH rails
- supported fiat payout processors
- USDC wallet withdrawal
- SDM wallet withdrawal (optional)

Optional incentive programs (for example a 2% crypto-withdraw bonus) can be activated by policy.

### 5. Secure Wrapper Participation (Advanced)

For users who choose on-chain product participation, SDM wrapper products provide structured exposure:

- **wSDM** (SDM + WBTC)
- **gSDM** (SDM + XAUT)
- **sSDM** (SDM + USDC)

These wrapper contracts implement:

- slippage-protected mint/redeem
- fee-adjusted quote functions
- stale-price protection (3-hour threshold)
- optional ratio enforcement
- restricted emergency withdrawal and pause controls

### 6. Governance Participation

Community governance can propose and vote on:

- fee-band policy updates
- wrapper parameter/risk limits
- treasury allocation ranges
- expansion of TheTube/OnlyShellz capture policy
- QIP upgrades

Governance tooling supports delegated participation and transparent on-chain records.

### 7. Contribution and Reputation

Participation quality is tracked through Wavz and contribution systems:

- verifiable milestones and anti-fraud checks
- contribution history for reputation and governance weighting
- transparent event data for analytics and accountability

### 8. Safety and Compliance Expectations

- mainstream users are not required to hold crypto
- viewer credits are utility features, not investment products
- creator payout access can require KYC/KYB by jurisdiction
- AML monitoring applies to scaled payout and on-chain flows

By keeping the entry path simple and the settlement layer optional, the ecosystem allows mainstream
usage first and advanced token participation when users are ready.
