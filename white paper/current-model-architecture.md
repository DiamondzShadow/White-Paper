# Current Model Architecture (2026)

#### Current Operating Structure

This chapter defines the **live operating model** of the Diamondz Shadow ecosystem and should be treated as
the canonical structure for how the whitepaper is read.

The model is no longer organized as a legacy token-first narrative. It is now organized as a
**product + transaction-flow + value-capture** system:

1. **Ecosystem Product Layer** (user activity and monetization flows)
2. **Wavz Validation Layer** (milestones, creator integrity, anti-fraud)
3. **Token Value-Capture Layer** (`$Crabby`, `$SDM`, and secure SDM wrappers)
4. **Infrastructure + Governance Layer** (chain, contracts, treasury, risk controls)

---

### 1) Ecosystem Product Layer (Primary User Surfaces)

Current ecosystem projects include:

- **CrabbyTV** ([crabbytv.com](https://crabbytv.com))
- **TheTube** ([thetube.media](https://thetube.media))
- **OnlyShellz** ([onlyshellz.live](https://onlyshellz.live))

CrabbyTV remains the primary qualifying transaction-capture surface in the current model,
where creators and audiences transact across:

- Live streaming and creator rooms
- Films and premieres
- Spades and competitive interactions
- AMAs and paid creator events
- NFT-linked creator monetization

These activities generate platform transaction flow. A qualifying subset is routed into the
`$Crabby` value-capture rail under published fee policy and governance controls.
Integration policy for TheTube and OnlyShellz is part of the broader governance expansion path.

### 2) Wavz Validation Layer (Trust and Reputation)

Wavz transforms verified creator progress into an auditable progression model:

- **Milestone Units**
- **Creator Credits**
- **Reputation Badges**
- **Wavz Score**

This layer supports creator discovery, fraud resistance, and progression-linked product mechanics.

### 3) Token Value-Capture Layer (Split by Economic Role)

#### CRABBY (`$Crabby`) - Platform Transaction Capture

- Receives value accrual from qualifying CrabbyTV transaction flows.
- Aligns token value with real creator-platform activity.
- Designed for usage-linked growth rather than speculation-only demand.

#### SDM (`$SDM`) - Network + Exchange Rail

- Native network token for Diamond zChain transaction execution.
- Revenue-linked rail associated with **https://zdiamondex.store/**.
- Distinct from `$Crabby` platform-transaction capture.

#### Secure SDM Wrapper Rail (`wSDM`, `gSDM`, `sSDM`)

- Extends SDM participation into BTC/gold/USDC-backed wrapper baskets.
- Adds diversified upside framing while keeping SDM central in basket design.
- Uses hardened wrapper controls (slippage limits, stale-price checks, fee-transparent quotes,
  optional ratio enforcement, and restricted emergency withdrawal logic).
- Planned expansion includes **40Acres (RWA)** wrapper baskets with gold/BTC/stock-linked components.

---

### 4) Infrastructure + Governance Layer

The model is executed through:

- Diamond zChain (Arbitrum Nitro-based L3 architecture)
- Oracle and data validation systems
- Treasury and risk controls
- Governance/QIP process for parameter changes and upgrades

---

### Value-Flow Snapshot

1. Users and creators transact across ecosystem project surfaces (CrabbyTV, TheTube, OnlyShellz).
2. Wavz validates creator milestones and trust signals.
3. Qualifying CrabbyTV flow contributes to `$Crabby` value pathways.
4. Network and exchange-side flow contributes to `$SDM` pathways.
5. SDM wrappers provide additional structured exposure using secure contract controls.

### Web2 Surface, Web3 Rail - Operating Numbers

Reference operating scenario used in this whitepaper:

- 10,000 monthly active users
- $12 average monthly gifting per user
- $120,000 monthly gifting volume
- 20% platform share ($24,000/month)
- 80% creator share ($96,000/month)
- 40% optional creator crypto withdrawal participation
- $38,400/month derived on-chain payout flow

Execution principle: users are not forced into crypto purchases; crypto appears as optional creator payout and settlement rails.

### How to Read the Remaining Whitepaper

To stay aligned with the current model, read in this order:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Current Model Architecture (this chapter)**
3. **Introduction**
4. **Technology and Infrastructure**
5. **Tokenomics**
6. **Economic Model**
7. **Roadmap / Participation / Governance**

Legacy model chapters are retained for historical context, not as the primary operating narrative.
