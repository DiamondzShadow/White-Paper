# Diamondz Shadow Ecosystem

#### Diamondz Shadow Ecosystem

### Overview of the Ecosystem

> **Context note:** This chapter is retained as legacy ecosystem context.
> The current operating model is defined in `current-model-architecture.md` and the updated Executive Summary.
> Canonical token/value routing for current operations is:
> **$Crabby** (qualifying CrabbyTV flow), **$SDM** (network/exchange flow), and secure wrappers
> **wSDM/gSDM/sSDM** for SDM-collateralized extension.

Diamondz Shadow runs as a product-first creator ecosystem with explicit value routing and governance controls.
Current project surfaces are:

- **CrabbyTV** (primary qualifying transaction-capture surface)
- **TheTube**
- **OnlyShellz**

### Current Ecosystem Structure

#### 1) Product Layer

Users and creators engage through films/premieres, live sessions, Spades and competitive formats,
AMAs, paid interactions, and creator monetization tools.

#### 2) Validation Layer (Wavz)

Creator progression and trust are structured through:

- Milestone Units
- Creator Credits
- Reputation Badges
- Wavz Score

#### 3) Value-Rail Layer

- **$Crabby** captures qualifying CrabbyTV transaction flow.
- **$SDM** captures network and exchange-aligned value flow (including zdiamondex.store-aligned activity).
- **wSDM / gSDM / sSDM** provide secure SDM wrapper extension rails.

#### 4) Infrastructure and Governance Layer

Diamond zChain, oracle systems, treasury policy, and governance workflows execute and audit the model.

### Wrapper Expansion Upside: Tokenized Stocks + Gold/BTC

The wrapper architecture can be expanded through governance to include stock-linked baskets combined with
gold/BTC collateral components.

Potential basket pattern examples:

- SDM + tokenized large-cap stock + BTC
- SDM + tokenized growth stock + gold
- SDM + sector stock basket + BTC/gold hedge mix

Key upside drivers:

1. **Diversified exposure**: balances growth-linked equity behavior with hard-asset hedges.
2. **Richer product suite**: supports multiple basket classes by risk profile.
3. **Broader user fit**: serves users seeking non-single-asset exposure inside a crypto-native format.
4. **Treasury resilience**: diversified reserve composition can improve stress-period stability.

### Revenue Integration (Different Revenue Lines)

The ecosystem is designed to generate multiple revenue channels instead of a single-source model:

1. **Project transaction capture**
   - qualifying CrabbyTV classes (policy-defined ranges)
   - governance-expandable TheTube/OnlyShellz modules
2. **Network and exchange rail revenue**
   - SDM-linked gas and execution activity
   - exchange/business-aligned flows
3. **Wrapper protocol revenue**
   - mint/redeem fees
   - liquidity and routing fees
4. **Stock-linked wrapper revenue (expansion)**
   - strategy basket issuance/redemption fees
   - index/analytics access and structured product pathways
5. **Oracle and data services**
   - validation, fraud scoring, and API services

### Governance and Risk Controls

Governance controls:

- qualifying capture definitions and fee bands
- wrapper asset approvals and ratio limits
- oracle freshness and safety thresholds
- treasury allocation ranges and incident-response policy

Safety controls include slippage bounds, stale-price guards, pausable operations, and restricted emergency paths.

### Legacy Architecture Context

Historic references to TuBE, GaM3, and DuSTD are retained for design lineage.
They are not the canonical current-model rails unless explicitly reactivated by governance.
