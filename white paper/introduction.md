# Introduction

#### Introduction

### Reframing the Whitepaper Around the Live Model

This whitepaper now follows the **current operating structure** instead of the older ecosystem-first format.
The active model starts with product usage and then maps how value is captured and secured.

At a high level:

1. **Ecosystem projects** include:
   - **CrabbyTV** ([crabbytv.com](https://crabbytv.com))
   - **TheTube** ([thetube.media](https://thetube.media))
   - **OnlyShellz** ([onlyshellz.live](https://onlyshellz.live))
2. **CrabbyTV** is the primary qualifying transaction-capture surface in the current policy model.
3. **Wavz** validates creator progression and trust signals.
4. **$Crabby and $SDM** capture value through different economic rails.
5. **wSDM / gSDM / sSDM** extend SDM exposure through secure wrapper baskets.
6. **Next wrapper expansion** can include governance-approved stock-linked baskets
   (for example SDM + tokenized stock + gold/BTC components).

### Web2 Surface, Web3 Rail Philosophy

The operating model is intentionally staged:

- Front-end: gifts, badges, balances, creator earnings
- Back-end: mirror ledger, optional wallet withdrawals, batched on-chain settlement

Reference planning numbers:

- 10,000 active users x $12 monthly gifting average = $120,000 monthly gifting volume
- 20% platform share = $24,000/month
- 80% creator share = $96,000/month
- 40% creator crypto-withdrawal participation = $38,400/month optional on-chain payout flow

### The Core Problem We Are Solving

Creator platforms still leave users with fragmented monetization and weak ownership alignment:

1. Revenue is concentrated in centralized platform models.
2. Creator progress signals are easy to spoof without robust validation.
3. Token narratives often drift away from real product transaction flow.
4. Users lack transparent mapping from platform activity to token value capture.

### The Current Diamondz Shadow Solution

#### 1) CrabbyTV Product Layer

CrabbyTV is the user-facing layer for qualifying creator monetization flow:

- Films and premieres
- Spades and competitive formats
- AMAs and paid events
- NFT-linked creator activity
- Live and interactive creator experiences

This creates measurable, qualifying transaction flow.

#### 1b) Ecosystem Project Footprint

Beyond CrabbyTV, the ecosystem project set also includes:

- **TheTube** ([thetube.media](https://thetube.media))
- **OnlyShellz** ([onlyshellz.live](https://onlyshellz.live))

These projects are part of the broader ecosystem footprint and integration roadmap.

#### 2) Wavz Validation Layer

Wavz anchors trust and progression through:

- **Milestone Units**
- **Creator Credits**
- **Reputation Badges**
- **Wavz Score**

This makes creator progression auditable and usable across product features.

#### 3) Split Token Value-Capture Rails

- **CRABBY ($Crabby)** captures qualifying CrabbyTV platform transaction flow.
- **SDM ($SDM)** captures network and exchange-aligned value (including
  [zdiamondex.store](https://zdiamondex.store/)).
- This separation is intentional and central to the current economic model.

#### 4) Secure Wrapper Layer for SDM Upside Extension

SDM can be wrapped into:

- **wSDM** (SDM + WBTC)
- **gSDM** (SDM + XAUT)
- **sSDM** (SDM + USDC)

These wrappers implement security-focused mint/redeem logic:
slippage checks, fee-adjusted quotes, stale-price guards, pause controls, and restricted emergency withdrawal.

#### 5) Expansion Upside: Tokenized Stocks + Gold/BTC Baskets

Beyond current wrapper products, the same architecture can support governance-approved baskets that include:

- SDM + tokenized stock exposure (for example large-cap equity tokens)
- SDM + gold-backed collateral
- SDM + BTC-backed collateral

Why this matters:

1. **Diversified upside profile**: combines growth-oriented equity exposure with hard-asset hedges.
2. **Lower single-asset dependency**: reduces concentration risk versus single-token positions.
3. **New revenue pathways**: mint/redeem fees, liquidity-pool fees, treasury routing, and analytics/licensing products.
4. **Product differentiation**: creates strategy-specific baskets for different risk preferences.

### Why This Structural Update Matters

The old structure described a broader long-range tokenization vision first.
The current structure leads with:

1. Product behavior
2. Validation and trust
3. Value routing
4. Contract and infrastructure safety

This improves clarity for builders, users, reviewers, and governance participants.

### How to Read the Whitepaper

Use the following sequence for the current model:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Current Model Architecture (2026)**
3. **Technology and Infrastructure**
4. **Tokenomics**
5. **Economic Model**
6. **Roadmap / Participation / Governance**

Legacy model sections remain available as historical context and design lineage.
