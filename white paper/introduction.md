# Introduction

#### Introduction

### Reframing the Whitepaper Around the Live Model

This whitepaper now follows the **current operating structure** instead of the older ecosystem-first format.
The active model starts with product usage and then maps how value is captured and secured.

At a high level:

1. **CrabbyTV** is the primary product surface where creator and audience transactions happen.
2. **Wavz** validates creator progression and trust signals.
3. **$Crabby and $SDM** capture value through different economic rails.
4. **wSDM / gSDM / sSDM** extend SDM exposure through secure wrapper baskets.

### The Core Problem We Are Solving

Creator platforms still leave users with fragmented monetization and weak ownership alignment:

1. Revenue is concentrated in centralized platform models.
2. Creator progress signals are easy to spoof without robust validation.
3. Token narratives often drift away from real product transaction flow.
4. Users lack transparent mapping from platform activity to token value capture.

### The Current Diamondz Shadow Solution

#### 1) CrabbyTV Product Layer

CrabbyTV is the user-facing layer for creator monetization:

- Films and premieres
- Spades and competitive formats
- AMAs and paid events
- NFT-linked creator activity
- Live and interactive creator experiences

This creates measurable, qualifying transaction flow.

#### 2) Wavz Validation Layer

Wavz anchors trust and progression through:

- **Milestone Units**
- **Creator Credits**
- **Reputation Badges**
- **Wavz Score**

This makes creator progression auditable and usable across product features.

#### 3) Split Token Value-Capture Rails

- **CRABBY ($Crabby)** captures qualifying CrabbyTV platform transaction flow.
- **SDM ($SDM)** captures network and exchange-aligned value (including
  [zdiamondex.store](https://zdiamondex.store/)).
- This separation is intentional and central to the current economic model.

#### 4) Secure Wrapper Layer for SDM Upside Extension

SDM can be wrapped into:

- **wSDM** (SDM + WBTC)
- **gSDM** (SDM + XAUT)
- **sSDM** (SDM + USDC)

These wrappers implement security-focused mint/redeem logic:
slippage checks, fee-adjusted quotes, stale-price guards, pause controls, and restricted emergency withdrawal.

### Why This Structural Update Matters

The old structure described a broader long-range tokenization vision first.
The current structure leads with:

1. Product behavior
2. Validation and trust
3. Value routing
4. Contract and infrastructure safety

This improves clarity for builders, users, reviewers, and governance participants.

### How to Read the Whitepaper

Use the following sequence for the current model:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Current Model Architecture (2026)**
3. **Technology and Infrastructure**
4. **Tokenomics**
5. **Economic Model**
6. **Roadmap / Participation / Governance**

Legacy model sections remain available as historical context and design lineage.
