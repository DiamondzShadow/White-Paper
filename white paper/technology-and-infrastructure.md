### MVP Protocol: Wavz - The Beat of the Creator

#### Web2 Oracle Infrastructure for Social Media Validation

**Wavz** is our comprehensive social engagement validation system that serves as the foundational MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the entire Diamondz Shadow ecosystem. Branded as "The Beat of the Creator," Wavz transforms real-world social media engagement into on-chain verified achievements through a progressive gamification system.

The Wavz system brings real-world social media data on-chain through cryptographically verified oracles, enabling trustless verification of creator achievements across all social platforms. The YouTube Milestone implementation demonstrates our first live use case, with the architecture designed to scale across Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, and all major social media platforms.

#### The Wavz Progression System

Wavz gamifies creator milestones through a four-tier progression that rewards consistent engagement:

**1. Milestone Units** (Individual Milestones):
- The foundational unit of the Wavz system
- Each milestone achievement generates Milestone Units
- Examples: 100 YouTube subscribers, 500 Twitter followers, 1K TikTok views
- Milestone Units are recorded on-chain with AI validation confidence scores
- Creators earn token rewards for each milestone achievement

**2. Creator Credits**:
- Accumulated from multiple Milestone Units across platforms
- Formula: 10 Milestone Units = 1 Creator Credit
- Represents consistent creator growth and cross-platform presence
- Used for platform benefits, governance weight, and tier unlocks
- Credit balances can decay slowly to incentivize ongoing engagement

**3. Reputation Badges**:
- Earned when Creator Credits reach specific thresholds (e.g., 100 Creator Credits = 1 Reputation Badge)
- Represents sustained creator momentum and authentic engagement
- Reputation Badges unlock premium platform features and higher reward multipliers
- Trading Reputation Badges creates a secondary market for creator reputation
- Reputation Badges are non-fungible, carrying metadata of achievement history

**4. Wavz Score** (Valid Engagement Score):
- The ultimate metric of creator influence and authenticity
- Combines on-chain and off-chain engagement data
- Formula: Milestone Units × Creator Credits × Reputation Badges × Engagement Quality Score
- Recorded to blockchain as immutable reputation NFTs
- Wavz Score determines creator tier, reward rates, and platform privileges
- Used by investors and brands to assess creator authenticity

**Wavz Validation Process**:
```
Social Milestone Achieved → Oracle Validation → AI Confidence Score → 
Milestone Units Generated → Creator Credits Accumulated → Reputation Badges Unlocked → 
Wavz Score Updated → Blockchain Recording
```

This progression ensures that only creators with genuine, sustained engagement across multiple platforms can achieve high Wavz scores, making the system Sybil-resistant and valuable for investment decisions.
