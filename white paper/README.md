### Diamondz Shadow Token (SDM) White Paper
### Diamondz Shadow White Paper (Current Model)

## Revolutionizing Media Production Through Comprehensive Tokenization
## Multi-Project Creator Structure with Split Token Value Rails

## Executive Summary

The Diamondz Shadow ecosystem represents a paradigm shift in media production and consumption
through comprehensive tokenization of all content forms. Built on our custom Diamond zChain
(a Layer 3 blockchain leveraging Arbitrum Nitro technology), we have created a framework that
tokenizes everything from movies and music to gaming achievements and social media streams.

This whitepaper has been restructured to reflect the **current operating model**, not the older
token-first presentation.

### MVP Protocol: Wavz - The Beat of the Creator

The live model is organized around real product usage and clear value-routing:

1. **Ecosystem project activity** across:
   - **CrabbyTV** ([crabbytv.com](https://crabbytv.com))
   - **TheTube** ([thetube.media](https://thetube.media))
   - **OnlyShellz** ([onlyshellz.live](https://onlyshellz.live))
2. **Wavz validation and progression**
   (Milestone Units -> Creator Credits -> Reputation Badges -> Wavz Score)
3. **Split value capture rails**
   - **$Crabby**: captures qualifying CrabbyTV platform transaction flow
   - **$SDM**: captures network and exchange-aligned value
     (including flow tied to [zdiamondex.store](https://zdiamondex.store/))
4. **Secure SDM wrapper layer** (`wSDM`, `gSDM`, `sSDM`) for BTC/gold/USDC-backed upside
   exposure with hardened controls
5. **RWA wrapper expansion** including **40Acres (RWA)** baskets combined with gold/BTC/stocks

**The Wavz Progression**:
- **Milestone Units**: Individual verified achievements
  (for example, subscriber or view thresholds)
- **Creator Credits**: Reputation credits accumulated from verified Milestone Units
- **Reputation Badges**: Higher-tier, non-fungible recognition unlocked at major credit thresholds
- **Wavz Score**: Composite reputation score combining milestone consistency, credits, badges, and quality

**Platform Coverage**:
- **Universal Project Validation**: Oracle system validating social, gaming, event, and pricing data
- **Project Validator Node Networks**: Projects run validators/nodes with stake-backed participation
- **Proof of Contribution Scoring**: Validator rewards weighted by uptime, accuracy, and consensus quality
- **AI-Powered Fraud Detection**: 95%+ accuracy in detecting fake followers, bot engagement,
  and metric manipulation
- **Platform-Agnostic Design**: Single oracle architecture scales across social APIs, betting/event feeds, and pricing providers
- **Cross-Project Identity**: Link accounts and participation signals to one unified reputation model

This framing keeps platform behavior, economics, and contracts aligned in one readable flow.

### What Changed vs the Old Whitepaper Structure

- **From legacy model**: broad ecosystem-first, multi-token-first narrative.
- **To current model**: CrabbyTV product flow first, then token value capture and infrastructure.
- Legacy sections are retained for historical context but no longer define the primary reading order.

### Oracle-as-a-Service Revenue Model

- **Oracle Validation Services**: $0.10-0.75 per validated milestone, event outcome, or pricing update
- **Validator/Node Infrastructure Licensing**: $10K-100K setup + $2K-25K/month for project node stacks and B2B oracle SDK
- **Sports/Event Oracle Packs**: usage-based feeds for betting and event settlement (NBA-style markets as reference)
- **Realistic Pricing Oracle Packs**: multi-source feeds for token/FX/commodity/index pricing
- **Identity & Reputation**: $10-29/month for cross-platform identity verification
- **API Access**: $99-2,500/month for oracle data access across all validated platforms
- **Platform Revenue Integration**: 10-15% fee on tokenized creator revenue (Phase 2)
- **Enterprise Solutions**: $50K-500K for custom oracle development and private networks

**Year 1 Projected Revenue**: $6.43M (Web2 oracle services)  
**Year 3 Projected Revenue**: $115M+ (full multi-platform oracle ecosystem)

## Current Model Snapshot

### Product Layer (Ecosystem Projects)

- Core ecosystem projects currently include **CrabbyTV**, **TheTube**, and **OnlyShellz**.
- CrabbyTV is the primary qualifying transaction-capture surface in the current value-routing policy.
- Additional project-level integration and capture policies are governance-expandable over time.
- Feature policy and fee bands are governance-managed with explicit risk controls.

### Core Token Infrastructure

- **SDM**: Custom gas token optimizing network operations with 100,000+ TPS capacity
- **$Crabby**: qualifying platform transaction-capture rail (CrabbyTV policy scope)
- **wSDM / gSDM / sSDM**: secure SDM wrappers for BTC/gold/USDC-backed exposure
- **40Acres (RWA) wrapper program**: planned expansion with gold/BTC/stock-linked basket overlays
- **Legacy expansion modules** (TuBE, GaM3, DuSTD): retained as optional governance-activated modules

In addition to serving as the core network token, SDM can be wrapped into BTC/gold/USDC-backed
baskets (`wSDM`, `gSDM`, `sSDM`) to provide upside-oriented exposure through collateral diversification.

### Token Layer (Role Separation)

- **CRABBY ($Crabby)**: value capture from qualifying platform transactions.
- **SDM ($SDM)**: network gas token + exchange/business revenue rail.
- **wSDM / gSDM / sSDM**: SDM-centered wrappers with diversified reserve backing.

Unlike traditional media models where centralized entities control production, distribution,
and monetization, Diamondz Shadow democratizes the process. Creators can tokenize work for
direct fan investment and transparent revenue, while audiences can support content they believe in.

### Contract Safety Layer (Secure Wrappers)

The secure wrappers implement:

- Slippage protection (`min*Out` checks on mint/redeem)
- Fee-adjusted quote functions
- Stale-price protections (3-hour freshness threshold)
- Restricted emergency withdrawals (underlying assets only)
- Optional ratio enforcement (50/50 or 20/80 targets with tolerance)
- Pausable operations and treasury-routed fees

### Operating Baseline Numbers (Reference Scenario)

- Active monthly users: **10,000**
- Average monthly gifting per user: **$12**
- Monthly gross gifting volume: **$120,000**
- Platform share (20%): **$24,000/month**
- Creator share (80%): **$96,000/month**
- Optional creator crypto withdrawal participation: **40%**
- Derived monthly on-chain payout flow: **$38,400**
- Optional rollout incentive: **2% payout bonus** on approved crypto-withdraw paths
